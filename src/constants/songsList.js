    lyric: `Fall into the deep end <br /> Feeling alive while you fight for your life <br />
    As you swim back to the beaches<br />
    Don't be scared of the tide just prepare for the ride<br />
    I think I'm misunderstood<br />I think I'm just under good<br />
    I think I'm not so bad<br />Tell me what's wrong with that<br />
    I think I'm over my head<br />
    I think I'm over depressed<br />
    I know I overthink<br />
    Spending nights over sinks<br />
    Throw up 'cause I can't find out why I'm sad<br />
    Everything is bad, but it seems fine<br />
    No signs of struggle, always neglected<br />
    Boy in the bubble can't be affected<br />
    Can't get in trouble, can't get seem to get that<br />
    If not for trouble, no learning lessons<br />
    Trying to be subtle, trying to be gentle<br />
    Physically fit but sick in the mental<br />
    Fall into the deep end<br />
    Feeling alive while you fight…<br />
